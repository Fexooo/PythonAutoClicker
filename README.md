# PythonAutoClicker
Just a Auto Clicker made in Python!

# Tutorial
1. If you don't have Python installed, install it and make sure the checkbox for adding Python to PATH is checked!
2. Launch install.py to install all necessary Components!
3. Now you can launch main.py or console.py!

# install.py
If you need to use the install.py file, make sure in your folder is no Install folder, because the install.py will save Files in a Install folder and delete it after finishing!

# Versions
There are 2 Versions from the Program!
One with a GUI and the other one used over the Terminal!

# Variation
What is Variation?
Variation is a range of Numbers, which changes the CPS in a random Way!

Which Values are normal?
The Program selects a random Number from this Range and multiplies it with the time in between the Clicks!
Normal Values are:
0.7 - 1.5
Also the Range should be very low and instead of a comma (,) you need to use a dot (.)!

# Error Codes
1 - CPS, Activation Key and Close Key are not set!
2 - Variation is not set!

# Known Bugs
- After pressing Start Program doesn't respond anymore for windows, but works in Background! (Fixed in Version 1.1)

# Games
If you use this in Games, I'm not responsible for any Bans!
